The project is about a basic Maze Game using Graph Structure for creating random maze map
In this game, I have built a bot that can find the shortest way to the goal using Dijkstra Algorithm

The game will scan the maze map using BFS in order to find the shortest way and save into path and
bot use it to find the way to go
